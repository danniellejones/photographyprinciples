      "definition": "Balance refers to the visual distribution of elements within a composition. It aims to achieve a sense of equilibrium and stability.",
      "detailedInformation": "In photography, balance plays a crucial role in creating harmonious and pleasing images. There are two types of balance: symmetrical and asymmetrical. Symmetrical balance involves dividing the frame into equal parts, creating a mirror-like effect. Asymmetrical balance, on the other hand, involves distributing visual weight unevenly to create interest and tension. Understanding and utilizing balance can help you create visually compelling photographs with a sense of stability or dynamic tension."

      "filename": "img_example_contrast.jpg",
      "definition": "Contrast refers to the difference between light and dark areas in an image. It adds visual interest and helps emphasize important elements.",
      "detailedInformation": "In photography, contrast is an essential tool to create impact and draw attention to specific subjects. It can be achieved through variations in brightness, color, or texture. High contrast images have a significant difference between light and dark areas, resulting in bold and dramatic visuals. Low contrast images have minimal differences, leading to a softer and more subtle appearance. Understanding how to manipulate contrast effectively allows you to control the mood, focus, and visual hierarchy in your photographs."
